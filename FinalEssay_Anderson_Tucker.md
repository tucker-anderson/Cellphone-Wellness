## Cell Phone Mindfulness Study

### Background

The advent of smart phones has had a tremendous impact on the daily
lives of people the world over. Smart phone use has become so pervasive
that now 96% of Americans own a smartphone, From browsing the internet
to texting your friends to playing Candy Crush, mobile cell phone usage
has increased dramatically in the past couple of years. Software is
eating the world and the mobile platform is providing users

The Screen Time application developed by Apple is included by default in
all iOS 12 and greater phones. This applications automatically tracks
the time and application use of the user, and seemed to be a great way
to measure our primary dependent variable of interest: time spent using
the phone each day or each week.

### Experimental Design

We designed a set of surveys to extract a sample of the populationâ€™s use
of cell phones. We isolated a subset of the population, only reaching
out to users who owned an Apple smartphone which had iOS 12 or higher
installed, to utilize the Screen Time app and ensure our measurement
methodology was consistent between all subjects. We believed the
consistent measurement benefit would outweigh the effects of leaving out
large subsets of the population such as Android phone users. The
assumption here is that there is no fundamental difference at the
population scale between Apple smartphone users and users of other
smartphone platforms. While it seems possible that there may be some

### Data Analysis

### Conclusion

Despite not being able to conduct a true field experiment, we were able
to gather a large baseline dataset of iOS users with their screentime
and a number of useful covariates.
